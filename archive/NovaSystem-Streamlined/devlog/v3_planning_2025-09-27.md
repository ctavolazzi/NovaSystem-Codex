# NovaSystem v3.0 Planning - 2025-09-27

**Objective:** Document the strategic decision to adopt a phased approach for UI development, culminating in a workflow-based interface for v3.0.

**Summary:**
Based on user feedback, a new strategic direction has been set for the NovaSystem UI. While the current chat interface will be polished (Phase 1), a new, more ambitious node-based workflow interface will be developed for v3.0 (Phase 2). This approach aims to create more compelling content for the associated YouTube channel and provide a more transparent user experience.

A new work effort has been created to track this long-term goal: `work_efforts/00-09_project_management/01_planning/01.01_novasystem_v3_workflow_ui.md`.

**Next Steps:**
- Focus on Phase 1: Polishing the existing chat interface.
- Defer active development on Phase 2 until Phase 1 is complete.
