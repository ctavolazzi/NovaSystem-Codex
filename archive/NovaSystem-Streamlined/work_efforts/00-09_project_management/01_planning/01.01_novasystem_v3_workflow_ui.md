## Objective
Scope and plan the development of a node-based workflow interface for NovaSystem v3.0 to provide a more transparent and engaging user experience, particularly for YouTube content.

## Tasks
### Phase 1: Finalize Chat Interface (v2.x) - Completed
1. [x] Conduct a final review and polish of the existing chat UI.
2. [x] Ensure all backend error states are gracefully handled in the UI.
3. [x] Add a "copy response" button to chat messages.
4. [x] Improve visual feedback for system status (e.g., connected, disconnected, error).

### Phase 2: Develop Workflow Interface (v3.0) - On Hold
1. [ ] Research and select a frontend framework for a node-based UI (e.g., React Flow, Svelte Flow).
2. [ ] Design the UI/UX for the workflow view, including nodes for agents, data, and processes.
3. [ ] Update the backend API to provide real-time, granular status updates for each agent/step in the workflow.
4. [ ] Implement the node-based frontend to visualize the multi-agent collaboration.
5. [ ] Develop a workflow execution engine or adapt the current one.
6. [ ] Implement complex state management for the workflow view.

## Progress
- Initial planning and scoping completed.
- Phased approach (v2.x polish, v3.0 workflow) has been decided.
- Phase 1 has been completed, delivering a polished and robust chat interface.

## Next Steps
1. Begin Phase 2: Research and select a frontend framework for the node-based UI.

## Notes
- The workflow interface is a significant undertaking but will be a key differentiator for the project and associated content.
- Phase 2 will begin once Phase 1 is complete.
