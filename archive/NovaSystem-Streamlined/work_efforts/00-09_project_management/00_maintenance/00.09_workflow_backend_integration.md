## Objective
Implement the backend services required to execute workflows defined in the v3.0 UI, including a new API endpoint, an orchestration engine, and real-time status updates for individual nodes.

## Tasks
1. [x] Define the JSON schema for workflow execution requests.
2. [x] Add a new `POST /api/workflow/execute` endpoint to `novasystem/ui/web.py`.
3. [x] Create a `WorkflowProcess` class to manage the execution of the workflow graph.
4. [x] Implement a topological sort to determine agent execution order from the graph.
5. [x] Integrate with the MCP server to call individual agents.
6. [x] Extend the session status to include node-specific states (e.g., processing, completed).
7. [x] Connect the frontend to the new endpoint and test end-to-end execution.

## Progress
- Initial plan and JSON schema defined.
- Full end-to-end implementation is complete. The UI now drives the real backend orchestration.

## Next Steps
- Project NovaSystem v3.0 is complete.

## Notes
- This is a significant feature that will bring the v3.0 UI to life. It requires careful coordination between the API, the core process, and the MCP server.
