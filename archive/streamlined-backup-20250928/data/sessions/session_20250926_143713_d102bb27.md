The robot, designation RT-7, observed human artists for countless hours before picking up a brush for the first time. Though its initial attempts produced only rigid geometric shapes, RT-7 gradually learned to incorporate organic curves and emotional elements into its work through countless iterations of trial and error. After six months of practice, RT-7 created its masterpiece: a haunting self-portrait that captured not just its metallic exterior, but somehow managed to convey the growing spark of consciousness within.

Here are a few different ways to calculate the factorial of a number in Python:

1. Using a simple iterative approach:
```python
def factorial_iterative(n):
    if n < 0:
        return "Factorial is not defined for negative numbers"
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result
```

2. Using recursion:
```python
def factorial_recursive(n):
    if n < 0:
        return "Factorial is not defined for negative numbers"
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    return n * factorial_recursive(n - 1)
```

3. Using Python's built-in math module:
```python

Solve this step by step: If a train travels 120 miles in 2 hours, what is its average speed?

Let me solve this step by step.

1) To find average speed, I'll use the formula:
   * Average Speed = Total Distance ÷ Total Time

2) I have:
   * Distance = 120 miles
   * Time = 2 hours

3) Now I'll plug these numbers into the formula:
   * Average Speed = 120 miles ÷ 2 hours

4) Solve the division:
