Here's a simple example of a linear regression algorithm, which is one of the most basic machine learning algorithms:

```python
# Linear Regression Example
import numpy as np

# Training data
X = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])  # Input features (e.g., hours studied)
y = np.array([2, 4, 6, 8, 10]) # Output labels (e.g., test scores)

# Simple linear regression formula: y = mx + b
# We need to find the best values for m (slope) and b (intercept)

# Calculate slope (m)
m = (np.mean(X * y) - np.mean(X) * np.mean(y)) / (np.mean(X * X) - np.mean(X) ** 2)

# Calculate intercept (b)

Let me break down the linear regression example step by step:

1. First, let's understand what linear regression does:
- It finds a linear relationship between input (X) and output (y)
- In this example, imagine X is "hours studied" and y is "test scores"
- The goal is to find a line that best fits the data

```python
import numpy as np

# Training data
X = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])  # Hours studied
y = np.array([2, 4, 6, 8, 10]) # Test scores

# The formula for a line is: y = mx + b
# where:
# m = slope (how steep the line is)
# b = y-intercept (where the line crosses the y-axis)

# Calculate slope (m)
m = (np.mean(X * y) - np.mean(X) * np.mean(y)) / (np.mean(X * X) - np.mean(X) ** 2)

# Calculate y-intercept (b)
b = np.mean(y) - m * np.mean(X)

# Now we can predict new values
hours = 6  # New input
predicted_score = m * hours + b
```
