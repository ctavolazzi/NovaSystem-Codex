## Objective
Fix the GUI chat functionality to correctly poll for and display results from the backend.

## Tasks
1. [x] Start the NovaSystem GUI.
2. [ ] Investigate backend API for correct polling endpoints.
3. [ ] Replace javascript in `index.html` with a corrected version.
4. [ ] Test the chat functionality.

## Progress
- Investigated backend API and found correct endpoints: `/api/sessions/{session_id}/status` and `/api/sessions/{session_id}/result`.
- Replaced javascript in `templates/index.html` with a corrected version that uses the proper endpoints and improved polling logic.

## Next Steps
1. Test the GUI chat functionality to confirm the fix.

## Notes
- The user-provided javascript had incorrect endpoints. Will adapt the logic with the correct ones.
