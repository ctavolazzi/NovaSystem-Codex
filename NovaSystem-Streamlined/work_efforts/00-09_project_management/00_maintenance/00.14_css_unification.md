## Objective
Streamline and unify the CSS system by consolidating multiple CSS files into a single, well-organized `globals.css` file with a standard name, and archive the redundant files.

## Problem Description
The NovaSystem Modern UI had multiple CSS files that were creating conflicts and inconsistencies:
- `globals.css` (Next.js default with dark mode)
- `base.css` (base styles)
- `layout.css` (layout utilities)
- `modern-theme.css` (modern theme)
- `variables.css` (design tokens)
- `windows-xp-theme.css` (Windows XP theme)

This led to:
- CSS conflicts between different theme files
- Dark mode overrides conflicting with intended themes
- Inconsistent styling across components
- Maintenance complexity with multiple files

## Solution Implemented
Created a unified `globals.css` file that consolidates all necessary styles into a single, well-organized file:

### 1. **Unified Design System**
- Combined all CSS variables into a single `:root` section
- Organized by logical categories (colors, typography, spacing, etc.)
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing variable names

### 2. **Component Styles**
- Unified button, input, and card styles
- Consistent hover and focus states
- Proper accessibility support

### 3. **Utility Classes**
- Comprehensive utility class system
- Responsive design utilities
- Layout and spacing utilities
- Typography and color utilities

### 4. **Modern Features**
- Tailwind CSS v4 compatibility
- Accessibility support (reduced motion, high contrast)
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Custom scrollbar styling

## Files Modified

### Created
- `src/styles/globals.css` - Unified CSS file with all styles

### Updated
- `src/app/layout.tsx` - Updated import path to use unified CSS

### Archived
- `src/styles/archive/base.css` - Archived base styles
- `src/styles/archive/layout.css` - Archived layout utilities
- `src/styles/archive/modern-theme.css` - Archived modern theme
- `src/styles/archive/variables.css` - Archived design tokens
- `src/styles/archive/windows-xp-theme.css` - Archived Windows XP theme

## Technical Details

### CSS Structure
```css
/* ========================================
   NOVASYSTEM - UNIFIED STYLES
   Single Source of Truth for All Styling
   ======================================== */

@import "tailwindcss/preflight";
@import "tailwindcss/utilities";

/* CSS Variables - Design Tokens */
:root {
  /* Color System */
  /* Typography */
  /* Spacing */
  /* Shadows & Effects */
  /* Borders */
  /* Transitions */
  /* Z-Index Scale */
}

/* Global Styles */
/* Component Styles */
/* Layout Utilities */
/* Responsive Design */
/* Animations */
/* Accessibility */
/* Scrollbar Styling */
```

### Key Features
- **Single Source of Truth**: All styles in one file
- **Design Token System**: CSS variables for consistent theming
- **Component Library**: Reusable button, input, and card styles
- **Utility Classes**: Comprehensive utility system
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach
- **Accessibility**: Support for reduced motion and high contrast
- **Modern CSS**: Tailwind CSS v4 compatibility

## Results
- ✅ **Eliminated CSS conflicts** between multiple theme files
- ✅ **Unified styling system** with consistent design tokens
- ✅ **Improved maintainability** with single file to manage
- ✅ **Better performance** with reduced CSS file complexity
- ✅ **Enhanced accessibility** with proper focus and motion support
- ✅ **Modern CSS practices** with Tailwind CSS v4 compatibility
- ✅ **Clean architecture** with archived redundant files

## Benefits
1. **Simplified Maintenance**: Single file to manage all styles
2. **Consistent Design**: Unified design token system
3. **Better Performance**: Reduced CSS complexity and conflicts
4. **Improved Developer Experience**: Clear, organized CSS structure
5. **Future-Proof**: Modern CSS practices and Tailwind v4 compatibility
6. **Accessibility**: Built-in support for accessibility features

## Notes
- The unified CSS file maintains backward compatibility with existing component classes
- All archived files are preserved in the `archive/` folder for reference
- The system now uses a clean, light theme by default (no dark mode conflicts)
- Future theme changes can be made by updating CSS variables in the `:root` section
- The file is well-documented with clear section headers for easy navigation

## Status
✅ **COMPLETED** - CSS system successfully unified and streamlined
