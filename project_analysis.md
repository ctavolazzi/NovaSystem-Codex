# NovaSystem Project Analysis

## Initial Summary (from README.md and pyproject.toml)

*   **Project:** NovaSystem
*   **Stated Goal:** A "Next-Generation Problem-Solving Framework" using AI expert simulation (Nova Process) and a code tool.
*   **Core Implementation (v0.1.1):** A Python CLI tool (`novasystem`) to automate cloning Git repos, parsing docs for install commands, and running them in Docker.
*   **Nova Process:** A conceptual prompting framework for LLMs detailed in the README, not directly coded in the Python package.
*   **Technology:** Python (>=3.8), Docker, Git. Key dependencies: `gitpython`, `docker`, `requests`, `tqdm`, `pytest`.
*   **Build:** Uses `setuptools`, configured in `pyproject.toml`.
*   **Status:** Alpha, experimental.

## Root Directory Files Analysis

### .gitignore

*   **Purpose:** Specifies intentionally untracked files for Git.
*   **Contents:** Includes standard Python exclusions (bytecode, virtualenvs, dist folders, test reports), OS-specific files (`.DS_Store`), IDE folders (`.vscode/`), logs (`logs/`, `*.log`), secrets (`.env*`), and `node_modules/`.
*   **NovaSystem Specific Exclusions:** `system_log.log`, `*.db` (likely for the run database), `OAI_CONFIG_LIST` (OpenAI config?), `/backups/`, `/test_repo/`.
*   **Significance:** Confirms standard practices for Python project version control and handling of sensitive/generated files.

### .gitattributes

*   **Purpose:** Defines attributes for paths for Git.
*   **Contents:** `* text=auto`.
*   **Significance:** Ensures consistent line ending handling across different operating systems (Windows/Linux/macOS) by letting Git manage conversions automatically.

### .env

*   **Purpose:** Stores environment variables for configuration, potentially including secrets.
*   **Structure:** Standard `KEY=value` format.
*   **Contents (Based on Keys):** Defines API keys (OpenAI, OpenWeather, News), database URL (`sqlite:///./nova.db`), LLM settings (Ollama host, default model/temp), and app settings (Debug, Log level).
*   **Significance:** Crucial for runtime configuration (API keys, DB connection). Correctly ignored by Git. Suggests potential integration with OpenAI, Ollama, weather, and news APIs.

### LICENSE

*   **Purpose:** Defines the legal terms for using, distributing, and modifying the software.
*   **Contents:** Standard text for the GNU General Public License v3 (GPL-3.0).
*   **Significance:** This is a strong copyleft license ensuring the software remains free and open-source. Derivative works must also be licensed under GPL-3.0.

### package-lock.json

*   **Purpose:** Records exact Node.js dependency versions for reproducible `npm` installs.
*   **Contents:** Minimal structure, lists no installed packages (`"packages": {}`).
*   **Significance:** Indicates `npm` has been used, but no specific Node.js dependencies are currently locked. This might relate to development tooling or a potential (currently inactive?) frontend component (README mentioned Svelte).

### .coverage

*   **Purpose:** Stores data generated by code coverage tools (e.g., `coverage.py`) during testing.
*   **Significance:** Confirms use of code coverage analysis. Correctly ignored by Git.

## `novasystem/` Directory Analysis (Source Code)

### `__init__.py`

*   **Purpose:** Initializes the `novasystem` package and defines its public API.
*   **Contents:**
    *   Sets `__version__` to "0.1.1".
    *   Imports key classes/enums (`RepositoryHandler`, `DocumentationParser`, `Command`, `DockerExecutor`, `DatabaseManager`, `Nova`, etc.) from submodules.
    *   Defines `__all__` to expose these components for library usage.
*   **Significance:** Establishes the package structure and public interface, confirming the modular design focused on repository handling, parsing, Docker execution, and database management.

### `__main__.py`

*   **Purpose:** Entry point when running the package directly (`python -m novasystem`).
*   **Functionality:** Imports and calls the `main` function from `novasystem.cli`, passing command-line arguments.
*   **Significance:** Standard mechanism for package execution, directing control flow to the CLI module (`cli.py`).

### `cli.py`

*   **Purpose:** Implements the command-line interface (`novasystem` command).
*   **Functionality:**
    *   Uses `argparse` to define commands (`install`, `list-runs`, `show-run`, `delete-run`, `cleanup`) and options (`--verbose`, `--output`, etc.).
    *   Configures logging to console and `~/.novasystem.log`.
    *   For each command, instantiates the `Nova` class (from `nova.py`).
    *   Calls corresponding methods on the `Nova` instance (e.g., `nova.process_repository`, `nova.list_runs`).
    *   Formats and prints results (text or JSON) or status messages.
    *   Handles command dispatching in the `main()` function.
*   **Significance:** Provides the user-facing interface and orchestrates calls to the core logic housed within the `Nova` class.

    *   `Command` (Class): Holds command text, source, type, context, location, priority.
*   **Initialization (`__init__`):** Optionally takes an `llm_client` for advanced parsing.
*   **Core Method (`get_installation_commands`):**
    *   Calls internal helpers to extract commands:
        *   `_extract_code_blocks`: Uses regex for fenced code blocks (```lang ... ```), determines type from language hint, splits shell blocks by line.
        *   `_extract_inline_code`: (Implementation not yet seen).
        *   `_extract_with_llm`: (Optional, uses LLM if regex yields few results).
    *   Calls `_deduplicate_commands`.
*   **Dependencies:** `re`.
*   **Significance:** Implements the logic for finding potential installation commands within text content, primarily using regex with an optional LLM enhancement.

*   **Helper Methods & Logic:**
    *   `_extract_code_blocks`: Finishes implementation; treats non-shell blocks as single commands.
    *   `_extract_inline_code`: Uses regex for inline code (`...`), filters with `_is_likely_command`, assigns type with `_detect_command_type`, calculates priority.

*   **Initialization (`__init__`):**
    *   Configures image name, resource limits (timeout, memory, cpu), network mode (defaults to `none`), and `test_mode`.
    *   Initializes Docker client using `docker.from_env()` (requires Docker daemon running).
*   **Core Methods (Part 1):**
    *   `create_image`: Builds the specified Docker image (`novasystem-base:latest` by default) using a dynamically generated Dockerfile. The Dockerfile includes Ubuntu 22.04 + common build/dev tools (Python, Node, Git, etc.) and sets up a non-root user.
    *   `check_image_exists`: Checks if the target image exists locally using `client.images.get()`.
*   **Dependencies:** `docker` (docker-py library).
