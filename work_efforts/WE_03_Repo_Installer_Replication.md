# Work Effort: WE_03 - Replicate Repo Installer Functionality

**Status:** Open

**Goal:** Explore the feasibility and design for replicating the core functionality of the NovaSystem v0.1.1 repository installation tool (cloning, parsing docs, secure execution) within the context of the web UI / bot simulation environment.

**Challenges & Considerations:**
- Secure execution environment (Docker integration)
- Robust documentation parsing and command extraction
- Command sequencing logic
- Filesystem access for cloning
- State management for multi-step processes
- Significant architectural changes compared to current simulation focus.
