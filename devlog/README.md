## $(date +%Y-%m-%d): Initiated Work Effort WE_01 - NovaSystem Vision Alignment

**Goal:** Enhance the NovaSystem codebase to begin implementing the broader vision outlined in the root README.md, moving beyond the v0.1.1 repository installation tool towards features like the Nova Process and potentially agent-based architectures.

**Initial Plan:**
1.  Define Scope (Prioritize vision elements).
2.  Architecture Design (Integrate new components).
3.  Component Implementation (Iterative: Base classes, Nova Process logic, LLM integration, UI).
4.  Testing.
5.  Documentation Update.

**(See `work_efforts/WE_01_VisionAlignment.md` for full details)**

*   $(date +%Y-%m-%d): Scope defined for WE_01 (Core Unit: Bot, Hub, Controller). Plan refined.

## How to Add New Entries

When making significant changes to the codebase, please document them by:

1. Creating a new markdown file with a descriptive name in this directory
2. Following the established format (summary, changes, testing, notes, next steps, lessons)
3. Adding a link to your entry in this README file

This helps maintain a historical record of the project's development and makes it easier for new contributors to understand the evolution of the codebase.
