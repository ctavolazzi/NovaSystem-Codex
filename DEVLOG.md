**Date:** {Current Date} - YYYY-MM-DD

**Summary:** Refactored `BaseBot` and `Controller` Logging/Paths & Updated Tests

**Details:**
*   Refactored `BaseBot` to separate action journaling (`journal.md`) and internal event logging (`bot.log`).
*   Updated `BaseBot` initialization to rely solely on a `base_path` parameter provided during instantiation.
*   Moved responsibility for determining bot/controller `base_path` into the `Controller` class.
*   Updated `Controller.__init__` and `Controller.create_bot` to calculate and provide the correct `base_path` to `BaseBot` instances.
*   Updated the entire test suite in `core_components/tests/test_core_components.py` to align with the new initialization logic, path structures, and logging files (`journal.md`, `bot.log`).
*   Encountered several test failures during execution related to:
    *   `ModuleNotFoundError` (resolved by running `python -m pytest`).
    *   Incorrect `BaseBot` ID handling in `test_basebot_init_default_id`.
    *   Missing imports for constants (`DEFAULT_JOURNAL_FILENAME`, etc.).
    *   Incorrect assertion counts/values in logging tests.
    *   Incorrect expected log level in an error handling test (`test_basebot_record_event_write_fails`).
*   Iteratively fixed the test failures.
*   Final test run (`python -m pytest core_components/tests/test_core_components.py -v`) confirmed all 31 tests passed.

**Outcome:** Core component refactoring and associated testing successfully completed.

## 2023-MM-DD - Creating Demo5 UI

**Work Effort:** [WE_02_Demo5_UI.md](work_efforts/WE_02_Demo5_UI.md)

**Plan:**
1.  **Framework:** Flask.
2.  **Structure:** Create `demo5_ui/` with `app.py`, `templates/` (`index.html`, `report.html`), `static/`.
3.  **Backend:** Routes for `/` (list runs), `/run` (trigger demo5.py), `/report/<run_id>` (view report).
4.  **Frontend:** Templates to display runs, trigger new runs, and show reports.
5.  **Dependencies:** Add Flask and Markdown to `requirements.txt`.

**Outcome:** Completed. A basic Flask application is available in `demo5_ui/`. It allows running `demo5.py` and viewing generated reports via a web browser.
